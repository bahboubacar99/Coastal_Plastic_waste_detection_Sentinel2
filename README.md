# Coastal_Plastic_waste_d-tection
In this project, we will detect plastic waste on the coastline of Jamestown in Accra, Ghana, using Sentinel-2 images. The S-2 images used in this project have been corrected for surface reflectance using the ACOLITE atmospheric correction model. In addition to the S-2 bands, we have spectral indices as well as bands obtained by spectral unmixing.
